# ☕ Coffee Machine Simulator (Python OOP Project)

A simple console-based Coffee Machine simulation built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python. This project models a real-world coffee vending machine that manages resources, processes payments, and prepares drinks based on user input.

## 🚀 Features

* 🧾 Interactive menu system (Latte, Espresso, Cappuccino)
* 💧 Resource management (water, milk, coffee)
* 💰 Coin-based payment processing
* 🧮 Automatic change calculation
* 📊 Resource and profit reporting
* ❌ Handles insufficient ingredients and insufficient payment scenarios

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project is organized into four main classes:

### `CoffeeMaker`

* Manages machine resources
* Checks ingredient sufficiency
* Deducts ingredients when making coffee
* Generates resource reports

### `MenuItem`

* Models individual drink items
* Stores ingredients and cost information

### `Menu`

* Maintains available drink options
* Searches for drinks by name

### `MoneyMachine`

* Processes coin input
* Validates payments
* Calculates and returns change
* Tracks total profit

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

* Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)
* Encapsulation
* Class attributes and instance attributes
* Dictionary data structures
* User input handling
* Control flow and condition checking


## 🎯 Purpose

This project is ideal for beginners learning Python OOP and for anyone looking to understand how object-oriented design can model real-world systems.

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add GUI version
* Add more drink options
* Persistent data storage for profit tracking
* Add unit tests
* Improve input validation
